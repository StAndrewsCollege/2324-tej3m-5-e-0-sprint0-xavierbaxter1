# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

Introduction: The goal was to develop a stable tower made out of 1 size 8.5x11 piece of paper

## Goal

My goal is to make a high paper tower that can stand for 30 seconds.

# The restrictions for this assignment were, #
- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

## Process

You will follow the steps outlined below (for both this sprint and those for our RoboCup design).

### Research


You will research and document technical resources that you believe will help you succeed at the sprint.

I decided to make cubes and stack them but it took up too much paper and the cubes were very difficult to make.

This diagram represents my research and main idea of this assignment, if there is a triangular base it increases the structural integrity and develops the paper easily.

### Prototyping

# Prototype #1 #

Firstly I started off simple, I folded the entire paper in half and put the long side up vertically, this was a simple idea. 

# Prototype #2 #

To increase the complexity of my first prototype, I ripped the original paper in half and then stacked them both sideways, this was very unstable since they weren'tre connected by anything except gravity.

# Prototype #3 #

I did this same for prototype 3 except ripped the paper into 3 difference sizes, large, medium and small and stacked them, next I cut lines in the stacked ones to increase the stability, this structure wasn't too stable however, and it took some tweaks to get it to stand up, firstly I divided the 3 pieces of paper into different sizes, large, medium, and small, next I made rips in the top of each paper except the small and put the other papers in like a puzzle so they held and maintained the weight.


# Prototype #4 #

I tried to connect every square but it soon started to fall sideways, this idea was generated off my original idea of stacking cubes but required less paper, it didn't get high though.


# Prototype #5 #

I found that if you have a stronger base you will be able to build higher without it falling, I made 3 pillars held by a paper that has a hole in the middle, than added a cylinder on top, although this wasn't as tall as my other prototypes, it was most stable one.


##   Conclusion ##

I used my engineering skills to make a stable enough structure, considering I couldn't use anything except paper.
